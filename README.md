# Weather-Forecasting-Analysis
### About the project:
Weather prediction is one of the most certainly required information in all over the regions It involves collecting global meteorological surface and upper-air observations, preparing global surface and upper air pressure, temperature, moisture, and wind analyses at frequent time intervals based upon these observations we predict some data for upcoming days weather conditions.

📊This project is divided into two modules:

> 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing and Analysis

> 2️⃣ Data Visualization



📌Technology and Tools used in project: 

> Python (Numpy and Pandas) 

> Excel 

> SQL (MySQL) 

> PowerBI (For Visualization) 

The first module required us to clean the dataset using pandas and query it using SQL to gain insights from the database.
